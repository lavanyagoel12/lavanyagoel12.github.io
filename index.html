        <h3>A Little Bit About Me...</h3>
        <p>I am a rising senior in highschool and enjoy all things STEM. I especially love computer science and coding. I love being able to solve problems with code and having the ability to help lots of people through this.</p>
        <p>In my free time I enjoy reading science-fiction books and watching science-fiction movies. The idea of robots taking over intrigues me and I really hope to live to see it happen (although I know from a CS point of view it will take a <strong>lot</strong> of time.)</p> 
        <p>I have done lots of activities relating to STEM through which I've gotten to learn a lot and have been able to explore my passions a lot. I hope to pursue a career in CS in the future so I can do what I love while also changing lives <3</p>
